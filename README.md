# 📚 Tech Chronicles by [Elijah Gathanga]

Welcome to my personal collection of blog articles where I explore the bleeding edge of modern software development. This repository is structured like a **living book** — a growing resource organized by parts, chapters, and topics. I write with a focus on clarity, practicality, and insight gained through real-world building.

Whether you're a developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or just curious, you'll find something valuable here.
