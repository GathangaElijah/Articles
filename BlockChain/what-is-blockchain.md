# What is blockchain?

## Introduction

"Blockchain" – sounds familiar? it's a term that's been buzzing around, right? Maybe it sounds super technical, or maybe you've already bumped into words like "peer-to-peer" (folks talking directly), "decentralized" (no single boss), "ledger" (a record book), "secure" (safe and sound), "transparent" (you can see what's up), and a whole bunch more.

But have you ever stopped to really think about what this blockchain tech actually is?

Well, that's exactly what this series is all about. I want to pull back the curtain on blockchain, bring it down to earth, and explore what it's all about and how it might just sneak its way into making things easier for your business or even your everyday hustle.

You'll find loads of definitions out there, but they all seem to circle back to a few core ideas. For me, in simple terms, Imagine a **shared, digital logbook where everyone in a network can see what exchanges or agreements are being jotted down**. Think of it as a community record that keeps track of what's happening.

## What are is core features?

This are the main characteristics of blockchain.

- **Consistency** - Information gets bundled into "blocks," and these blocks are linked together, one after the other, forming a "chain" – hence, "blockchain"! It's like a timeline of events, where everything is recorded as it happens, step by step.

- **Security** - Once something is written into this chain of blocks, changing it is a seriously big deal. It would need pretty much everyone in the network to agree. That's what makes blockchain so darn secure. It's tough to mess with the history.

- **Transparency** - For the most part, all the comings and goings recorded on the blockchain are visible to anyone who's part of the network. This openness helps build trust because everyone can see the records.

- **Distributed** - Instead of one central brain holding all the info, everyone on the network has their own version of the records. So, no single point of control – the power to share and see information is spread out.

In the next part, we will talk about the Applications, Types and Benefits of blockchain technology. Stick around, this is just the scratch on the surface.
