# What is blockchain(Part 2)
This part extends the previous section of what is blockchain. This gives the overview of the types of blockchain, benefits and its applications. This helps you understand how you can incorporate blockchain technology in your industry or business.

## Types of blockchain

Blockchain is a wide topic and am sure most people are not aware of the several types of blockchain.

1. **Public blockchain** - Anyone can join and participate in it. Examples are; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot etc.

2. **Private blockchain** - This is decentralized, peer-to-peer but one organisation governs the network. 

## Characteristics

- The controlling organisation determines who is allowed to participate.
- They execute a consensus protocol.
- the organisation maintains the blockchain.
- It can be run behind a  corporate firewall and even hosted on premises.

Example: a government could use a private blockchain to manage land certificates and track ownership history to combat fraud and land grabbing. This is actually one of the most practical and popular real-world use cases for private or permissioned blockchains.

3. **Permissioned blockchain** - This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions. This is essentially operates under private blockchains.

4. **Consortium blockchain** - Multiple organisation can share resposibility of maintaining the blockchain. They determine who may submit the transactions or access data.

Example: Several financial institutions may come up with a blockchain network to facilitate things like interbank payments, trade finance, and digital identity. Only the relevant parties receive the data instead of broadcasting it to the whole network.

## Benefits of blockchain technology.

1. **Greater trust** - Trust the blockchain protocol not the participants.
2. **Greater security** - Consensus on data accuracy is required from all the network participants. Changing the data also requires consesus from the whole network thus difficult to manipulate.
3. **More efficiency** - The ledger is shared among members of a network therefore there is no wasting time in record reconciliations. The rules live in a smart contract which is stored in a chain and is executed automatically.

## Applications of blockchain

1. Used in payments.
2. Used to store accounts and other transactions.
3. Tracking orders.
4. Used in payments accounts.
etc.
